Progress bar + toast notifications.

API integration with retry logic.

Deliverables

Functional upload UI.

Progress shown.

Success/error handled gracefully.

Day 5: Robust PDF Parsing Implementation

Parsing pipeline (three-tiered):

Fast path: PyMuPDF text extraction + heading detection (regex + font-size).

Heuristic path: fallback to paragraph splitting & offsets.

Fallback path: chunk whole text into overlapping ~250‚Äì400 token blocks with offsets (section_name="_auto_chunk_").

OCR (Tesseract) offered only for text-light PDFs.

Store sections with char_start, char_end, page, snippet.

Update paper status="parsed".

Deliverables

Parser extracts clean text for most PDFs.

Sections/chunks stored with offsets.

Fallback ensures no complete failure.

Day 6: Papers List Interface

Table view of papers: title, authors, status, upload date.

Status badges (uploaded, parsed, failed).

Polling or websockets for live status updates.

Search + filters (title, author).

Deliverables

Papers list UI working.

Status updates visible.

Day 7: Integration Testing

End-to-end test: upload ‚Üí parse ‚Üí display.

Handle corrupted PDFs gracefully.

Optimize memory usage for large files.

Polish UI transitions.

Deliverables

Stable pipeline.

Known failure cases logged, not crashing.

üìÖ WEEK 2: Embeddings + Graph
Day 8: Embedding Service with Caching & Batching

Embedding service: embed_texts(batch) using all-MiniLM-L6-v2.

Hash-based caching (sha256) to skip duplicates.

Batch API calls (32‚Äì64 chunks).

Upsert to Qdrant in batches (256‚Äì512).

Link embeddings in Evidence table.

Deliverables

Efficient embedding pipeline.

Cache saves cost on duplicates.

Evidence table links chunks to vectors.

Day 9: Semantic Search

API: GET /api/search/similarity?q=... ‚Üí embed query ‚Üí Qdrant search.

Return snippets, scores, metadata (paper, page, offsets).

Re-rank top 3 locally (BM25 optional).

Frontend: SearchBar + SearchResults.

Deliverables

Semantic search returns relevant results.

Results show context + source.

Day 10: Concept Extraction (Tiered)

Default: scispaCy NER for scientific entities.

Fallback: small LLM (GPT-4o-mini) with structured JSON output.

Dedup + normalize concept names.

Store Concept + Relation(paper‚Üîconcept).

Deliverables

Concepts extracted & stored.

Deduplication ensures clean graph.

Day 11: Graph API (Progressive)

Graph builder:

Nodes = Papers, Concepts.

Edges = paper‚Üîconcept, concept‚Üîconcept (basic).

API endpoints:

/api/graph/overview?limit=100 (small snapshot).

/api/graph/neighborhood/{id} (progressive expansion).

JSON format ready for Cytoscape.js.

Deliverables

Graph endpoints return structured JSON.

Supports filters + progressive loading.

Day 12: Graph Visualization

Cytoscape.js + React wrapper.

Paper nodes = rectangles; concepts = circles.

Progressive expansion (click node ‚Üí load neighbors).

Sidebar shows details of selected node.

Deliverables

Interactive graph works smoothly.

Expand/focus on nodes without lag.

Day 13: Graph Filters & Search

Filters: by type (dataset, method, metric), by year, by authors.

Graph search: highlight nodes by label.

Sidebar with related papers/concepts.

Deliverables

Graph UI with filters/search.

Lazy-load subgraphs for large sets.

UI polish: hover tooltips, transitions, legend.

Deliverables

Graph performs with >100 nodes.
